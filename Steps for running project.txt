mon ami is a server and network monitoring tool to help manage your internet infrastructure. It is written entirely in PHP, using a combination of a web UI front-end (built using the CodeIgniter web framework), MySQL for a database, and a backend processing script (also written in PHP) run via cronjob.

As of now, monami can monitor the availablity of TCP ports and ICMP responses.

Installation Instructions

Create a new MySQL database, and run ./monami.sql against it
To create a new user, insert a record into tblMonitoringUsers using your favorite sql admin tool. You'll need to md5hash the password.
Open ./monami/config/config.php and edit the line containing "$config['base_url']" to match your domain name
Open ./monami/config/database.php and edit the lines containing 'hostname', 'username', 'password' and 'database' to match the database you created in step 1 above.
Point your browser to the URL you set in step 3, and login with the credentials you set in step 2.
